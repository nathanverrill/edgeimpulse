# Template transformation block (Python)
Transformation blocks take raw data from your [organizational datasets](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tutorial-building-your-first-dataset) and convert the data into files that can be loaded in an Edge Impulse project. You can use transformation blocks to only include certain parts of individual data files, calculate long-running features like a running mean or derivatives, or efficiently generate features with different window lengths. Transformation blocks can be written in any language, and run on the Edge Impulse infrastructure.
